# ChainTargets for Torn

This makes a button on any profile page, which upon clicking, takes you to a random profile from the ones in the list.


## Installation

Install Chainfinder with your favourite userscript manager. I use Tampermonkey.

To install, download the code as a ZIP, extract all, and import the javascript file into your userscript manager.

Simple!


    
## Customisation

If you wish to customise the links that are selected from, you can open the .js file with your preferred IDE or Text editor, and edit the links variable:

```javascript
  var links = [
            "torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2410074",]
```
You can replace the entire list, or just insert new profiles. Make sure you add a comma after each new link :D
